# --- Custom Plugin Installations (outside of Oh My Zsh bundle) ---
# zsh-autosuggestions
# This typically needs to be cloned manually if not part of OMZ by default (it often is now)
# The postCreateCommand installs it, but if you want to be explicit:
# ZSH_CUSTOM=${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}
# if [ ! -d "${ZSH_CUSTOM}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions" ]; then
#     git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
# fi

# zsh-syntax-highlighting
# Same as autosuggestions, needs to be cloned if not part of OMZ
# ZSH_CUSTOM=${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}
# if [ ! -d "${ZSH_CUSTOM}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting" ]; then
#     git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
# fi

# Source the plugins that are manually installed
# source ${ZSH_CUSTOM}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
# source ${ZSH_CUSTOM}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
