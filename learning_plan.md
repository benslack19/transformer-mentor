Here's a plan, broken down into modules, with a strong emphasis on hands-on coding. Each module builds upon the last, culminating in a full understanding of Transformers.

**Core Principle:** For each component, we will first understand the theoretical concept, then implement it from scratch (or using fundamental libraries like NumPy/PyTorch), and finally, use higher-level libraries (like Hugging Face Transformers) to see it in action.

### **Resources and Tips:**

* **"Attention Is All You Need" Paper:** Read it section by section as you progress. Don't be afraid to reread.
* **The Illustrated Transformer by Jay Alammar:** An incredible visual explanation. Use it as a companion to your coding.
* **PyTorch Documentation:** Excellent resource for understanding nn.Module, Tensor operations, etc.
* **Hugging Face Transformers Documentation & Tutorials:** Extremely comprehensive and user-friendly.
* **Google Colab:** Provides free GPUs, essential for training larger models.
* **Start Simple:** Don't try to build the full Transformer from scratch in one go. Break it down into the smallest possible components.
* **Debugging:** Expect errors. Use print statements, pdb, and PyTorch's assert statements to check shapes and values at each step.
* **Visualize:** Use tools like Matplotlib to visualize attention weights or embedding spaces.
* **Community:** Leverage online communities (Stack Overflow, PyTorch forums, Hugging Face forums) if you get stuck.
* **Teach as you learn:** As you complete each module, try to explain it to an imaginary friend, or even better, a real person. This will highlight gaps in your understanding.
* **Version Control:** Use Git and GitHub to track your progress and manage your code.


# Using GPUs

You're hitting on a common and important workflow challenge in AI/ML development: how to seamlessly integrate local development with cloud-based GPU resources. The good news is that your Dev Container setup is a fantastic starting point for this\!

Here's a recommended workflow for using your repo with cloud GPUs, specifically focusing on Google Colab, while maintaining your comfortable Dev Container environment:

### **Recommended Workflow: Local Dev Container \+ Google Colab for GPU-Intensive Tasks**

The core idea is to do your *code development, version control, and CPU-based experimentation* locally within your Dev Container, and then use Google Colab (or other cloud GPU services) for *training and fine-tuning* that requires heavy GPU compute.

#### **Step 1: Develop and Version Control Locally (in your Dev Container)**

* **All your .py scripts, pyproject.toml, README.md, and Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files) reside in your local Git repository.** Your Dev Container provides a consistent, isolated environment for this.
* **Write your Transformer code:** Implement your models, data loading, training loops, etc., in .py files. Create Jupyter notebooks for experimentation, visualization, and step-by-step learning.
* **Use hatch (or uv) and ruff:** Maintain code quality and manage dependencies within your Dev Container.
* **Version Control:** Regularly commit and push your changes to a Git remote (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). This is *crucial* for syncing your work with Colab.

#### **Step 2: Transition to Google Colab for GPU Compute**

When you reach a module that requires GPU (like training a Transformer from scratch or fine-tuning a Hugging Face model):

1. **Open Google Colab:** Go to colab.research.google.com.
2. **Mount Google Drive (Optional but Recommended for Data/Models):** If you have large datasets or want to save trained models persistently, you can mount your Google Drive in Colab.
3. Python

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

4.
5. This will prompt you for authentication. Once mounted, your Drive contents will be accessible at /content/drive/My Drive/.
6. **Clone Your Repository:**
   * Open a new Colab notebook.
   * In a code cell, use git clone to pull your repository directly from GitHub (or your chosen Git host).
   * Python

\!git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
%cd your-repo-name \# Change into your repo directory

*
  * If your repo is private, you'll need to set up SSH keys or use a personal access token (PAT) for authentication.
7. **Install Dependencies in Colab:**
   * Colab environments come with many common ML libraries pre-installed (like PyTorch, Transformers).1 However, it's good practice to install your specific versions or additional libraries defined in your pyproject.toml.
   * Since you're using hatch, you'll likely want to install your project in editable mode. You can do this by running pip from the terminal inside Colab.
   * Python

\# Assuming you've cloned your repo and are in its root directory
\!pip install \--no-cache-dir \-e .\[dev\] \# Installs from pyproject.toml

*
  * The \! at the beginning of the line executes the command in the shell, which is useful for pip commands in Colab notebooks.
8. **Run Your Notebooks:**
   * Open the .ipynb file from your cloned repository within the Colab file explorer.
   * Ensure you have a GPU runtime selected: Runtime \> Change runtime type \> GPU.
   * Run your cells. The code will execute within Colab's GPU environment.
9. **Save Results & Push Changes:**
   * **Trained Models/Results:** If you generate large files (e.g., trained model weights, evaluation logs), save them to your mounted Google Drive (e.g., /content/drive/My Drive/your-repo-data/).
   * **Notebook Changes:** If you make changes to your .ipynb files in Colab, you'll need to save them. Then, in a Colab code cell (or by opening a terminal in Colab: Runtime \> Open in terminal), you can commit and push these changes back to your Git repository:
   * Bash

\# Ensure you're in your repo directory
\!git add your\_notebook\_name.ipynb
\!git commit \-m "Updated notebook with GPU training results"
\!git push

*
  * You'll likely need to configure Git with your username/email and potentially store credentials if it's a private repo.

#### **Step 3: Sync Back to Your Local Dev Container**

* Back in your local machine, within your Dev Container, perform a git pull to fetch the changes you pushed from Colab (including updated notebooks and references to new data/models on Drive).2

This iterative process allows you to keep your core code and version control local and consistent, while only "renting" the GPU power when you absolutely need it.

### **Alternative (More Advanced) Workflows:**

* **VS Code Remote \- Tunnels (experimental with Colab):** Some community projects (like vscode-colab or colab-connect) aim to let you connect your local VS Code *directly* to a Colab runtime via remote tunnels.3 This would give you a more integrated feel, as if your Dev Container was running on the Colab machine. However, these are often experimental, might have limitations, or could be against Colab's terms of service for free tiers.
* **VS Code Remote \- SSH to a Cloud VM:** If you graduate to a dedicated cloud VM (e.g., GCP Compute Engine, AWS EC2) with a GPU, you can use VS Code's Remote \- SSH extension to connect directly to that VM.4 Then, you can launch your Dev Container *on that remote VM*. This provides a truly seamless experience where your Dev Container effectively runs on the GPU machine. This is a more involved setup but offers the best integration.

For a learning project, the "Local Dev Container \+ Google Colab for GPU" workflow is the most straightforward and effective for balancing local development comfort with cloud GPU access.
